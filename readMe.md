https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/

This course has been designed by two professional Data Scientists so that we can share our knowledge and help you learn complex theory, algorithms and coding libraries in a simple way.

We will walk you step-by-step into the World of Machine Learning. With every tutorial you will develop new skills and improve your understanding of this challenging yet lucrative sub-field of Data Science.

This course is fun and exciting, but at the same time we dive deep into Machine Learning. It is structured the following way:

* Part 1 - Data Preprocessing
* Part 2 - Regression: Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, SVR, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression
* Part 3 - Classification: Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification
* Part 4 - Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering
* Part 5 - Association Rule Learning: Apriori, Eclat
* Part 6 - Reinforcement Learning: Upper Confidence Bound, Thompson Sampling
* Part 7 - Natural Language Processing: Bag-of-words model and algorithms for NLP
* Part 8 - Deep Learning: Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks
* Part 9 - Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, LDA, Kernel PCA
* Part 10 - Model Selection & Boosting: k-fold Cross Validation, Parameter Tuning, Grid Search, XGBoost

Moreover, the course is packed with practical exercises which are based on real-life examples. So not only will you learn the theory, but you will also get some hands-on practice building your own models.
